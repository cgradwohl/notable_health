# Notable Daily
#### A simple app that allows doctors to view their daily schedule. 



## Client
1. clone the repo
2. `cd client`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn start`

I built the client app using create-react-app as a starter template and then
added redux to manage state of the app. I spent most time here since I am a
bit rusty on front end(my current role is Backend python) and newish to React.

I wanted to build this in React to test my skills in a newer framework. 
I also knew from Pranay that Notable is built with React, so I felt is was
most applicable. 

I would like to re architect the components using a container component, and 
two presentational components.

## Server
1. clone repo
2. `cd server`
3. `cd npx nodemon index.js`

I build the server using vanilla node.js and used 'fs' module to write/read to
files to mimic a db. This was taken from another server file I had from one of
my side projects.

I used fs.readFile wrapped in a promise to ensure async
for performance.

## Final Thoughts
This was a great challenge and I hope I will not be dinged to much for taking to much time. I
wanted to challenge my self in new framework that was applicable to Notable.
Thank you all for your time!
